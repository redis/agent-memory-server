## When to Use These Features

| Feature | Use When |
|---------|----------|
| Query Optimization | Search results aren't matching user intent well |
| Recency Boost | Recent memories should rank higher than older ones |
| Advanced Vector Config | You need to tune performance or use custom distance metrics |
| Contextual Grounding | Extracted memories contain unresolved pronouns like "he" or "it" |

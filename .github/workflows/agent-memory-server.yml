# Tag Format Guide:
# - For TestPyPI (testing): server/v1.0.0-test
# - For PyPI (production): server/v1.0.0
#
# Use the script: python scripts/tag_and_push_server.py --test (for TestPyPI)
#                 python scripts/tag_and_push_server.py (for PyPI)
#
# This workflow uses PyPI Trusted Publishing (OIDC). Ensure the project is configured
# on PyPI to trust this GitHub repository before releasing.
